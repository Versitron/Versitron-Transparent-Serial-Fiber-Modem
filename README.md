## Transparent Serial Fiber Modem

**Seamless conversion of serial port signals to fiber while preserving full serial protocol transparency.**

- Supports RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, and similar serial interfaces  
- Converts serial data to fiber without altering timing or protocol behavior  
- Provides electrical isolation, eliminating ground loops, surges, and interference  
- Ideal for long-distance serial communication where reliability and transparency matter  

Perfect for applications where serial communication must behave identically over fiber as over copper.

## Legacy Protocol Fiber Integration

**Enable legacy serial-based devices and systems to operate over modern fiber-optic networks.**

- Supports older protocols and serial buses without requiring hardware or software changes  
- Allows existing equipment — sensors, controllers, terminal servers — to communicate over fiber  
- Minimizes retrofit cost by preserving legacy interfaces while upgrading physical transport layer  
- Ensures stable and reliable operation even in electrically harsh environments  

A strong choice for industrial facilities, legacy control systems, or any deployment needing backward-compatibility.

## Fiber Converter for Serial Bus

**Convert entire serial bus communications into fiber for secure, long-distance data transport.**

- Handles serial bus protocols over RS-232/422/485 and similar serial standards  
- Converts to fiber-optic links, enabling longer runs, EMI immunity, and electrical isolation  
- Useful for SCADA networks, distributed sensor arrays, building management systems, and remote control points  
- Ensures robust, clean data transport for multi-device serial buses  

Ideal for distributed control systems, automation networks, and large facility communication backbones.

## RS-232 Baud Rate Over Fiber

**Maintain full RS-232 baud rates and data integrity even when extending communication over fiber.**

- Supports transparent baud-rate operation over fiber — no degradation in speed or reliability  
- Preserves serial timing, flow control, and protocol behavior across distance  
- Prevents interference, surges, and ground-loop issues common to long copper runs  
- Suitable for legacy terminals, industrial equipment, and remote serial devices migrating to fiber optics  

A dependable solution for updating RS-232-enabled systems to modern fiber infrastructure without sacrificing performance.
